    "# Peak shaving and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The power grid is designed to provide a reliable service. This often means that components are dimensioned to support the highest anticipated demand even if this occurs rarely. High load power peaks are undesirable, since they lead to oversized expensive infrastructure to avoid grid disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To persuade big consumers to reduce their peak power, their electricity bill includes, besides the regular energy consumption costs, charges for the maximum power measured during the billing period.\n",
    "The consumers could reduce costs by adapting their consumption behavior, accommodating more flexible loads to low consumption times.\n",
    "An alternative if this flexibility is not available, is to introduce a battery storage system to shift the loads and perform peak-shaving.\n",
    "Overall the load profile will be flattened, while the consumption remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "* Explore peak-shaving with energy storage as a way to reduce power peak costs.\n",
    "* Use optimization models to determine the peak-shaving strategy.\n",
    "* Extend our optimization models to size our storage system."
